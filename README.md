# Simple-website-blocker
Just a plain file editing technique for blocking your sites


Since it edits system file from here : in windows-"C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts" and in linux and mac-"\etc\hosts" you have to run this program with administrative privilages.

I know I know, for a simple website blocker it takes more privilege and the code is so simple that a newbie learner could do it :(
You can also automate to run this script by using "task schedular" in windows, something called "crontab" in linux(since i never used mac so i don't know what is used to auto start the program, you can search it over internet)
